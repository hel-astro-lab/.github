# Helsinki Computational Plasma Astrophysics Lab

We are the `hel-astro-lab` group at the [Physics Department](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-science/faculty/physics) of [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en), Finland. We develop scientific, high-performance simulation software for astrophysics. We provide our codes as freely-available open-source software on this page.
